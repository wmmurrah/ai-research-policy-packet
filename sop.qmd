title: "Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)"
---


This SOP maps the research lifecycle to concrete steps, artifacts, and gates.


### Gate 0 — Project registration (before any AI use)
- File an **AI Use Case** entry: purpose, data types, tools, access, risks, roles.
- Create initial **Risk Register** and **Reproducibility Bundle** skeleton (repo with `env.lock`, `prompts/`, `logs/`).


### Stage 1 — Ideas & literature
- Use AI to brainstorm/search; verify against sources.
- Artifact: **AI Use Log** entries; **Source List**.


### Stage 2 — Grant/protocol drafting
- Only nonconfidential text may be processed; use enterprise tools.
- Artifact: **Disclosure note** (if AI used for editing), **Access attestations**.


### Stage 3 — IRB/ethics & data rights
- Update protocol to reflect AI processing; include consent language.
- Artifact: **IRB-approved language**, **License/TDM memo**.


### Stage 4 — Data collection & curation
- De-identify data; produce **Datasheet for Datasets**.
- Artifact: Datasheet v1; **Data License** file; **PII risk assessment**.


### Stage 5 — Analysis & modeling
- Use AI for code suggestions/tests; lock seeds and environments.
- Artifact: **Model Card**; **Evaluation report** (accuracy, subgroup fairness, robustness); **Change log**.


### Stage 6 — Results verification & reporting
- Independent checks; bias & robustness analyses.
- Artifact: **QA checklist**; **Signed verification** by QA Lead.


### Stage 7 — Writing & authorship
- Human-led drafting; disclose AI assistance and verification steps.
- Artifact: **AI Use Statement** in manuscript; prompt archive for major uses.


### Stage 8 — Peer review & editorial work
- No public AI use on confidential content.
- Artifact: **Reviewer attestation** (if applicable).


### Stage 9 — Publication, sharing & archiving
- Deposit code/data (as permitted) with licenses and metadata.
- Artifact: **Repository DOI**, **README**, **Data/Model Cards**, **AI Use Log** export.


### Stage 10 — Deployment & translation
- Define intended use/out-of-scope; user disclosures; monitoring plan.
- Artifact: **Deployment risk assessment**, **User docs**, **Incident log**.
