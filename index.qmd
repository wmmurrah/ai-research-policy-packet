title: "Overview & Quick Start"

:::{.callout-note}
**Purpose.** This packet provides a departmental policy, standard operating procedures (SOPs), stage-by-stage checklists, and ready-to-paste templates for disclosing and documenting AI use in research.

:::


## Who this is for
Researchers, PIs, data stewards, model owners, and editors/reviewers affiliated with **[INSTITUTION] — [DEPARTMENT]**.


## Quick-start: Ten Rules
1. **Don’t upload confidential material** (unpublished manuscripts, grants, identifiable data, licensed instruments) to public AI tools.
2. **Humans are responsible.** AI is never an author; disclose substantive AI assistance.
3. **Log your AI use** (tool+version, prompts, inputs by type, outputs kept, human checks).
4. **Prefer enterprise or local tools** approved by [INSTITUTION].
5. **Verify claims** and cite original sources, not the model.
6. **No AI for peer review** of confidential manuscripts or proposals.
7. **Protect participants**: IRB approval for AI processing; de-identify first.
8. **Document datasets and models** (Datasheets & Model Cards).
9. **Track risks** (privacy, bias, IP, security, misuse) and mitigations.
10. **Be reproducible**: save prompts, seeds, code, data versions, and environments.


## Roles & accountability
- **PI:** ultimate sign-off on AI use, risk register, and disclosures.
- **Data Steward:** storage, access control, de-identification.
- **Model Owner:** model card, evaluations, updates.
- **Project QA Lead:** verifies logs, prompts, reproducibility bundle.


## How the packet is organized
- **policy.qmd** – Department policy (scope, definitions, roles, permitted/prohibited uses, disclosure, procurement, training, enforcement).
- **sop.qmd** – Stage-by-stage procedures aligned to the research lifecycle.
- **checklists.qmd** – One-page checklists and green/yellow/red lists.
- **templates.qmd** – Disclosure language, IRB snippets, Reviewer attestation, Datasheet & Model Card templates, CSV headers for logs.
- **general-doc-analysis** - General analysis of existing documents, sops, and policy on AI use in research.
- **appendices.qmd** – External references and mappings to national and international guidance.


::: {.callout-tip}
**Smart defaults for [INSTITUTION].** Enforce a strict ban on public AI use for confidential content, require ICMJE-style disclosure of AI assistance, and adopt NIST AI RMF as the governance spine. Adapt state/funder specifics in *Appendix A*.
